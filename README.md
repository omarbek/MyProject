What is it?
This is the display of text "Hello, World!" written in Java language.

How have i done it?
Client realized with AJAX + Bootstrap.
Server addressed to database with Hibernate.
It connected through the Spring.
Application automatically collected with Maven.
Database contains only two fields: id(int(11)) and text(varchar(255)).

I think that you understand and can run the code.
