What is it?
This is the display of text "Hello, World!" written in Java language.

How have i done it?
Client realized with AJAX + Bootstrap
Server addressed to database with Hibernate
It connected through the Spring
Application automatically collected with Maven.

I think that you understand and can run the code.
